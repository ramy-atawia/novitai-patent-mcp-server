# MCP Session Management Analysis

## Finding: This is STANDARD MCP Protocol Behavior

After thorough investigation of the official MCP Python SDK source code, I can confirm that **the session ID requirement is part of the standard MCP protocol**, NOT a FastMCP-specific implementation.

## Evidence from Official MCP SDK

### Source: `mcp/server/streamable_http_manager.py` (Official MCP SDK)

Line 209-279 shows the official session management logic:

```python
request_mcp_session_id = request.headers.get(MCP_SESSION_ID_HEADER)

# Existing session case
if request_mcp_session_id is not None and request_mcp_session_id in self._server_instances:
    transport = self._server_instances[request_mcp_session_id]
    logger.debug("Session already exists, handling request directly")
    await transport.handle_request(scope, receive, send)
    return

if request_mcp_session_id is None:
    # New session case - CREATE NEW SESSION
    new_session_id = uuid4().hex
    http_transport = StreamableHTTPServerTransport(
        mcp_session_id=new_session_id,
        ...
    )
    # ... setup and start server ...
    await http_transport.handle_request(scope, receive, send)
else:
    # Invalid session ID case
    response = Response(
        "Bad Request: No valid session ID provided",
        status_code=HTTPStatus.BAD_REQUEST,
    )
```

## How Official MCP Session Management Works

### 1. First Request (No Session ID)
- Client sends request WITHOUT `mcp-session-id` header
- Server creates NEW session with `uuid4().hex`
- Server returns session ID in `mcp-session-id` response header
- Server handles the request

### 2. Subsequent Requests (With Session ID)
- Client includes `mcp-session-id` from first response
- Server looks up existing session
- Server reuses that session transport

### 3. Invalid Session ID
- Client sends session ID that doesn't exist
- Server returns `400 Bad Request: No valid session ID provided`

## Why Your Client is Failing

Your external client is likely:

1. **Not reading the session ID** from the first response headers
2. **Not including the session ID** in subsequent requests
3. **Reusing an old/invalid session ID** that the server doesn't recognize

## The "TaskGroup" Error Explained

The error "Failed to connect to server: unhandled errors in a TaskGroup (1 sub-exception)" occurs because:

1. Your client makes a request with an INVALID session ID
2. Server returns `400 Bad Request`
3. Your client's async task group doesn't handle the 400 error properly
4. The unhandled exception crashes the TaskGroup

## Solution: Proper MCP Client Implementation

### Correct Flow:

```python
import requests

SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:8003/mcp"
session_id = None  # Start with no session

def make_mcp_request(method, params):
    global session_id
    
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Accept": "application/json, text/event-stream"
    }
    
    # Add session ID if we have one
    if session_id:
        headers["mcp-session-id"] = session_id
    
    payload = {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "method": method,
        "params": params,
        "id": 1
    }
    
    response = requests.post(SERVER_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)
    
    # Extract session ID from response if present
    if "mcp-session-id" in response.headers:
        session_id = response.headers["mcp-session-id"]
        print(f"Got session ID: {session_id}")
    
    return response

# First request: initialize (gets session ID)
response1 = make_mcp_request("initialize", {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "capabilities": {},
    "clientInfo": {"name": "my-client", "version": "1.0"}
})

# Second request: list tools (uses session ID)
response2 = make_mcp_request("tools/list", {})
```

## Conclusion

### ‚úÖ Our Implementation is CORRECT

The FastMCP server is correctly implementing the **official MCP protocol specification** for HTTP/StreamableHTTP transport. The session ID requirement is not a bug or FastMCP-specific quirk‚Äîit's how MCP is designed to work.

### ‚ùå Your External Client Needs Updates

Your external client must be updated to:
1. Extract `mcp-session-id` from response headers
2. Store the session ID
3. Include `mcp-session-id` in all subsequent requests
4. Handle 400 errors gracefully (don't crash the TaskGroup)

### üìö References

- Official MCP SDK: `mcp/server/streamable_http_manager.py`
- FastMCP Documentation: https://gofastmcp.com/deployment/http
- Session ID Header: `MCP_SESSION_ID_HEADER = "mcp-session-id"`

## Testing

The provided `test_fastmcp_client.py` script demonstrates the correct implementation and works perfectly with our server.
