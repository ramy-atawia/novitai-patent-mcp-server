FastMCP Proxy Server for Novitai Patent MCP Server

This proxy wraps the existing MCP server with FastMCP functionality,
providing additional features without requiring code changes to the original server.

Features added by FastMCP:
- SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport
- Enhanced client compatibility
- Better error handling
- Advanced transport options
- Production deployment features

Usage:
    python fastmcp_proxy.py

The proxy will connect to your existing server and expose it with FastMCP features.
