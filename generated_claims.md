# Patent Claims - Drafted Claims on AI

## Claim 1 (Independent)
A method for training an artificial intelligence (AI) model, comprising:  
receiving a plurality of training data sets, each data set including input data and corresponding labeled output data;  
processing the training data sets using a neural network architecture configured to learn feature representations from the input data;  
adjusting the parameters of the neural network based on a loss function computed from the difference between the predicted outputs and the labeled output data;  
wherein the training process employs a dynamic learning rate schedule that adapts based on the convergence rate of the loss function, thereby optimizing training efficiency and model accuracy.

## Claim 2 (Dependent)
The method of claim 1, wherein the neural network architecture includes at least one convolutional layer and at least one recurrent layer, configured to process both spatial and temporal features of the input data.

## Claim 3 (Dependent)
The method of claim 1, further comprising deploying the trained AI model to a cloud-based platform for real-time inference, wherein the platform utilizes containerization to facilitate scalable and secure deployment.
